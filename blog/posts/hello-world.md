Welcome to my blog. This space will capture things I learn, projects I ship, and small write-ups I’d otherwise forget.

## Why a blog?

- To think in public
- To create a searchable archive for myself
- To share notes that might help someone else

## What to expect

Short, useful posts. Occasional deeper dives. Lots of personal takes.

```js
console.log('Let’s build.');
```
